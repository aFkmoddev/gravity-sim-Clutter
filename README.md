# 🪐 Reverse Gravity Simulation in Rust

Hello friends! 👋  
Welcome to this experimental project where we explore a **distortion of gravity** itself.  
In this simulation, planets act **against gravity** — moving and interacting in unexpected ways!

---

## 🌌 Project Overview

This project is written in **Rust** and aims to visualize a world where gravity behaves in reverse.  
It's a small step toward understanding how physics can be twisted for fun and creativity.

You can use this project as an **inspiration** to build something even cooler! 😄
